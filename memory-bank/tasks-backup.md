   - [x] Provide descriptive service name and description
   - [ ] Verify profile selection and persistence

#### Phase 3: Documentation and Validation
5. **README Documentation**
   - [x] Add Gotenberg service description to "What's Included" section
   - [x] Document API endpoints and usage examples
   - [x] Include service URL in access list
   - [x] Add relevant use cases for n8n integration

6. **Final Report Script**
   - [x] Add Gotenberg section to scripts/06_final_report.sh
   - [x] Include hostname, internal access, and API endpoints
   - [x] Follow existing service reporting pattern

7. **Testing and Validation**
   - [ ] Test complete installation flow with Gotenberg selected
   - [ ] Verify service accessibility via configured hostname
   - [ ] Test API endpoints and document conversion functionality
   - [ ] Validate environment variable generation

### Testing Strategy

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full installation test with Gotenberg enabled
- [ ] Service accessibility test via domain
- [ ] API endpoint functionality test
- [ ] Environment variable persistence test

#### Compatibility Tests
- [ ] Test with other services enabled/disabled
- [ ] Verify no conflicts with existing services
- [ ] Test wizard selection persistence
- [ ] Validate Caddy configuration reload

### Dependencies
- Docker Compose profiles system (existing)
- Caddy reverse proxy configuration (existing)
- Environment variable generation system (existing)
- Service selection wizard framework (existing)

### Challenges & Mitigations

#### Challenge 1: Service Integration Consistency
**Problem**: Maintaining consistency with existing service patterns
**Mitigation**: Follow exact patterns used by similar services (e.g., crawl4ai, letta) - IMPLEMENTED

#### Challenge 2: Resource Requirements
**Problem**: Gotenberg may require additional memory for document processing
**Mitigation**: Document resource requirements and set appropriate limits in Docker Compose - IMPLEMENTED

#### Challenge 3: API Security
**Problem**: Gotenberg doesn't have built-in authentication
**Mitigation**: Rely on Caddy reverse proxy and network isolation, document security considerations - IMPLEMENTED

#### Challenge 4: Service Discovery
**Problem**: Ensuring n8n can properly communicate with Gotenberg
**Mitigation**: Document internal service URLs and provide usage examples - IMPLEMENTED

### API Usage Documentation

#### Internal Service URL
- Internal Docker network: `http://gotenberg:3000`
- External access: `https://gotenberg.yourdomain.com`

#### Common Use Cases for n8n
- Convert HTML to PDF in workflows
- Transform documents between formats
- Generate reports from data
- Process uploaded documents

### Creative Phases Required
**None** - This is a straightforward service integration following established patterns.

### Next Steps
Upon completion of implementation phase:
- Complete testing and validation tasks
- Verify all changes work correctly
- Mark task as complete
