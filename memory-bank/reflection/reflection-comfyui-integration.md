# Reflection: ComfyUI Integration (Level 2)

## Summary
Added ComfyUI as an optional service using Docker Compose profile `comfyui`, proxied via Caddy at `COMFYUI_HOSTNAME`. Default CPU support, optional GPU planned. Updated `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Caddyfile`, `scripts/04_wizard.sh`, `scripts/06_final_report.sh`, and `README.md`.

## What Went Well
- Followed existing installer patterns (profiles, Caddy host blocks, env generation/wizard/reporting) with minimal, clear edits
- Simple reverse proxy through Caddy; WebSocket support expected to work without extra config
- Compose config validated successfully

## Challenges
- No single “official” Docker image; community images differ in volume layout and flags
- Volume paths for models/output/custom_nodes vary by image; chose a conservative mount point for persistence
- GPU enablement requires NVIDIA toolkit and compose device reservations (not universally available)

## Lessons Learned
- Keep defaults CPU-first to minimize friction; add GPU as an opt-in
- Abstract image details behind a validation checklist (port 8188, volume paths, CLI flags)
- Document model storage and persistence expectations explicitly

## Improvements / Next Steps
- Consider adding a GPU-specific profile variant (e.g., `comfyui-gpu-nvidia`) when environment supports it
- Evaluate switching to a more widely adopted/maintained image and standardize volume mappings
- Extend final report with quick pointers to model directories and basic usage tips

## Verification Checklist
- Implementation reviewed end-to-end: YES
- Successes documented: YES
- Challenges documented: YES
- Lessons learned documented: YES
- Process/Technical improvements identified: YES

## Impact
- New optional service enabling visual Stable Diffusion workflows in the installer with minimal complexity
